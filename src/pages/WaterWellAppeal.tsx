              Amina Mwende, a mother of six from Kilifi County, used to walk three hours each day to collect water from a distant river. Her children often fell sick from waterborne diseases, and she had no time to earn income for her family.

            <p>
              When a water well was built in her village, everything changed. Her children are now healthy and attending school. Amina has started a small vegetable garden using the clean water, generating income for her family.
